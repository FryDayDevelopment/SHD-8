# SmartThings Smart Home Dashboard
I created this project to help others that might be interested in creating their own custom SmartThings Smart Home Dashboard.

The project is being documented here:  https://frydaydevelopment.com/smartthings-smart-home-dashboard-1/

I am developing this on a Raspberry Pi 4B using the following languages/libraries:

Python
	Flask
	Flask-Socketio
	Eventlet
	Flask-Login
	Flask-Sqlalchemy
	Werkzeug
	Requests
	Json
	Datetime
HTML
	Javascript
	Font Awesome
	Bulma
